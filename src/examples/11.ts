 * n prisoners are standing on a circle, sequentially numbered from 0 to n âˆ’ 1.
 * An executioner walks along the circle, starting from prisoner 0, and kills
 * every k-th prisoner.  As the process goes on, the circle becomes smaller and
 * smaller, until only one prisoner remains, who is then freed.
 *
 * @param n Number of prisoners (integer greater than 0)
 * @param k Kill every k-th prisoner (integer greater than 0)
 * @returns the prisoner number that survives this grim process
