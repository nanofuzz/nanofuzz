# NaNofuzz
NaNofuzz is a fast, easy-to-use automatic test generation tool for Typescript that integrates with a developer's VS Code workflow.  We like working code, and NaNofuzz is designed to be used during initial development to more quickly reach working code nirvana.  NaNofuzz is available in the [the VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=penrose.nanofuzz).

Unlike some past automatic test generation tools, NaNofuzz takes an approach similar to fuzzing and uses a simple implicit oracle to determine whether or not a given test passes. Surprisingly, this approach quickly finds many errors! NaNofuzz marks a test as failed if it:
 - throws a runtime exception
 - returns null, NaN, Infinity, or undefined
 - does not terminate within a configurable period of time

These design choices allow NaNofuzz to be fast, lightweight, easy to integrate into an everyday workflow, and helps programmers quickly find important edge cases they may have missed.

NaNofuzz supports standard and arrow functions with any mixture of the following parameter types:
 - Numbers (integers and floats, signed and unsigne)
 - Strings
 - Booleans
 - Literal object types
 - n-dimension arrays of any of the above
 - Optional and mandatory parameters

The following are not yet supported:
 - Type references
 - OR types, Tuples, Generics, or Function parameters
 - Deconstructed types
 - Object methods
 - Saving auto-generated tests for use in CI
 - Compiling to module formats other than CommonJS
