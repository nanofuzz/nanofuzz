# NaNofuzz npm package

The npm package nanofuzz-package (we can definitely change the name if needed) contains the type definitions needed to NaNofuzz with custom validators. These type definitions are: FuzzIoElement and FuzzTestResult.

To install the package, first run `npm install nanofuzz-package`.

Then, import the types at the top of the script: `import {FuzzIoElement, FuzzTestResult} from 'nanofuzz-package';`
